That said, the Debian package that this software creates consists of
'wallpaper': image files and an XML file to make the wallpaper
accessible in a gnome environment.  What could possibly go wrong?

The program included requires a library that has (as of June 17, 2020)
not been publicly released.  However, that program was used merely to
create the image file(s) that have been included and is not needed after
the image file(s) have been created. Parts of it may be useful for
illustrative purposes (there are more efficient algorithms for
computing a Hilbert space-filling curve but this program only needed
to be run a very small number of times).

On Debian systems, version 3 of the GPL license can be found in the
